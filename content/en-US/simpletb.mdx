summary: "Your brand new (Windows) taskbar."
return: "I prefer the old one"
---

The SimpleTB is a web application that replaces the Windows taskbar with a more modern and minimalist design.
Initially, the project was developed to improve the user experience of the Windows operating system, that I get tired of the old design of the taskbar.

# How?

The SimpleTB was developed using the Tauri framework, which allowed the creation of a desktop application using web technologies.
I used the React library to create the interface, but most of the code is in the Rust programming language, which allowed me to call Windows API and modify almost everything.
Using the Windows API, I was able to hide the default taskbar and place mine above, create a blur effect on windows, setup hooks and further more.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Moeefa/simpletb).

# Conclusion

The SimpleTB was a project that allowed me to improve my knowledge in the Rust programming language and the Windows API, which allowed me to create a more modern and minimalist taskbar for the Windows operating system.

See you. ðŸ‘‹
