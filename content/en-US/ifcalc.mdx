IFCalc is a web application that allows the calculation of grades for students at the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso.

# Why?

The biggest incentive for the creation of IFCalc was the disorganization of the SUAP system and the automation of the processing of grade calculations.

# How?

The SUAP was developed using the Python programming language, with the Django framework.
Using the Django framework, it was possible to create a new OAUTH authentication system, which allowed the creation of a new API for the SUAP system.

The IFCalc was developed using Next.js, which allowed the creation of a dynamic and responsive interface.
I deployed using the Vercel platform, which allowed the creation of a free and easy-to-use hosting service.

# Conclusion

IFCalc was a project that allowed the automation of the calculation of grades for students at the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso, which allowed students to better organize their grades.
